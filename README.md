In the reposotory are contained: 
- SBML file Model Version 1

The models here contained are companions to the work "S. Boecker et Al, An Integrated Approach to Decipher the Physiological Response of Escherichia coli Under High ATP Demand. 2021. Manuscript subbmitted for pubblication."

Model Version 1 and 2 differs for the introduction of regulatory terms in the PFL and PYK reaction and the adaptation of some parameters (See "Supplementary File 3"). These changes were introduced to test hypoteses on the physiological response of E. coli subjected to high ATPase activity. 
Exaustive information on the models can be find in the "Supplementary File 3" of the forementioned paper.

# Description
The model describes the central carbon and energy metabolism of E. coli growing under anaerobic conditions.
The model was developed to analyze the effect of enforced ATP turnover in the cell. 
It contains 32 metabolites and 26 reactions consisting of two compartments (cytoplasm and external environment). The following major pathways are included: glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS), glycolysis, two anaplerotic reactions (PEP carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase), left and right branch of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle active under anaerobic conditions, the main fermentative pathways (leading to the fermentation products lactate, ethanol, acetate, formate and succinate), transport reactions between cytoplasm and external environment, a biomass synthesis reaction and finally a reaction (denoted by ATPM) for ATP hydrolysis whose activity depends on the level of the overexpression of the ATPase genes.
